"I could be a secretary."
"Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, becauseit involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
"I could do that."
"What are you playing with?"
"Oh, it's my new beeper."
"What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?"
"Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're stillextinct.'"

"Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating thisguy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
"What?"
"Could tonight be the Night?"
"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... youknow. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
"So, did you shave your legs?"

"Hey, hey. How was the first day?"
"Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice."
"See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonderwhat he means) Me."
"No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you."
"Why not?"
"Oh, because, you know... they don't like you."
"What?!"
"I thought you knew that."
"Noho. Who doesn't they like me?"
"Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone."
"What are you talking about?"
"Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you gotpromoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr.Bing, "Boss Man Bing"."
"I can't belive it."
"Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
"They do me?"
"You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report"

"Oh, oh Chandler..."
"Oh... Yeah, you do."
"'The hills were alive with the sound"
"(reaches for hi scones) My scones."
"Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so"
"That is so"
"Did not."
"I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought thatgunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen."
"How was that possible?"
"Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being heldup, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking:why does people continue to go there? (He checks his watch.) Oh, ah. I should go."
"Okay."
"Okay."
"Unless..."
"What?"
"Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so..."
"Yeah, I'd really like that."
"Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is somethingyou should know."
"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretlymarried to a goat?'"
"Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technicalsense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh..."
"Ethan?"
"Yeah?"
"Are you a virgin?"
"Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes Iam. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person."
"Really?"
"Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?"
"Wow!"
"You keep saying that."
"You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even whenyou practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that."
"Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. AndI, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to."
"Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong."
"No-no. Nothing wrong about that."
"Oh."
"Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months."
"Huh!"
"But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, whatthe hell does it matter how old we are."
"Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have anotherone for you. I'm a little younger than I said."
"You're not a senior?"
"Oh, I'm a senior... in High School."
"Ok...ay."
"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn'talive during the Bicentennial."
"I just had sex."
"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
"Well, you never told me how old you were."
"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48states. What were you thinking?"
"I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'..."
"Don't say it. (closes Ethan's mouth with her hand)"
"...in love with you."
"Really?"
"(nods) Sorry."
"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a schoolnight. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'mJoan Collins."
"Who?"
"(on phone) Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie,bye bye. (to Phoebe) Just easier that way."
"Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
"No, forget it."
"Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
"All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. (Camera fades toRoss, who's listening very carefully) Joey was there too."
"All right. (Moves closer.)"
"Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there."
"No."
"You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?"
"No, it was just the three of us."
"Huh!"
"So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you andme and Chandler?"
"(laughs) You know what?"
"What?"
"There were times when it wasn't even me."
"That is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)"
"Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?"
"(shouting) Mon!"
"What?"
"Ethan called again."
"Oh."
"Are you not seeing him anymore?"
"No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out."
"And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to getout of gym."
"I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. Hestopped by."
"Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one thestrongest"

"Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people."
"Work people? Nobody told me."
"No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know,them-not-liking-you-extravaganza."
"You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends.You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person."
"Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them.Let them see what a great guy you still are."
"You think I should?"
"I really do, yeah."

"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and Idoing"
"You were great. But they still made fun of you."
"What?"
"You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. CaringBoss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., Iwanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!""
"Then, I don't get it."
"Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like,the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them...They still say you're a great boss."

"It was."
"Then, what's the problem?"
"Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
"Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?"
"This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If youwere a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times,I would really..."
"No, don't say it. (closes Monica's mouth with his hand)"
"...love you."
"Are you're hands still wet?"
"Uh, moist, yeah."
"Let's dry 'em again."
