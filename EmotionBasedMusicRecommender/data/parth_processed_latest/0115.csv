You're not gonna need my help?,Frustration

"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)",Excitement
"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.","Loneliness, Gratitude, Love, Heartbreak, Trust, Betrayal"
"Ok, you got it!","Achievement, Satisfaction"

(placing Hugsy back in the crib) There you go sweetie...  (to Emma) This isn't over.,Affection
"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  (reads from the screen) gay as the day is long""?""","Frustration, Anger, Irritation"

(faking sympathy) And so young.,Frustration
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.,Frustration
"Well, how you died was funny.",Unknown
"Oh please, hit by a blimp?",Unknown
It kills over one americans every year.,"Fear, Panic"
"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.","Frustration, Worry, Fear"
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!,Unknown
"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.","Frustration, Betrayal, Anger"

"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",Frustration
"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.","Affection, Engagement, Curiosity"
"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. (pause) Give me your phone.","Frustration, Anxiety, Confusion"
Here.,Frustration

"No, no, it's not a girl, it's...  a brand new Hugsy!",Excitement
"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.","Enthusiasm, Affection"
"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.","Frustration, Confusion"
"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...","Affection, Love, Nostalgia"
Make the transfer! (She does so),"Achievement, Satisfaction"
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,"Frustration, Worry"
"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",Satisfaction
"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",Frustration
But he's the same.,Frustration
"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.","Frustration, Nostalgia"
But he's the same.,Frustration
"Joey, come on!",Frustration
He's the same!,"Frustration, Jealousy"
(to the new Hugsy) You're not the same!,Frustration
Haha!,"Enthusiasm, Joy"
"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",Frustration
"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",Frustration
Those are my shoes.,Satisfaction
"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.","Affection, Excitement"
"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.","Loneliness, Gratitude, Relief"
Who's that? (goes to open door),Curiosity
I ordered Chinese food.,Satisfaction
What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,Frustration
(To Mike) What are you doing here?,Frustration
Phoebe called me.,Satisfaction
Phoebe!,"Excitement, Relief"
"I'm sorry, I broke down...  I wanted to see him.","Frustration, Heartbreak"
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,Frustration

Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!,"Frustration, Determination"
"Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...",Frustration
(to Mike) This doesn't concern you!!,Frustration
"Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!",Confusion
"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",Frustration
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,"Frustration, Boredom, Loneliness"
"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend (to Phoebe) and Mike's friend (Mike is sceptical).","Enthusiasm, Affection, Jealousy, Trust"

"uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)",Excitement
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?,Frustration
"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little Ross is dead"" joke didn't work",Frustration
"No, come on, you know that's not true.",Frustration
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!,"Frustration, Jealousy"
"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",Frustration
I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa),"Frustration, Jealousy, Disappointment"
"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.","Frustration, Disappointment"
You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.,Frustration
"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",Frustration
Exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing),"Achievement, Satisfaction"

"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",Frustration
Original or crappy?,Frustration
Original.,Unknown
"No, sorry haven't seen him.",Frustration
Then what's that big lump under your covers?,Frustration
"It's Monica, ok?","Frustration, Irritation"
That's not Monica!,Frustration
"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..","Frustration, Jealousy"
(to herself) Oh God.,Frustration
... she's being unreasonable!,Frustration
"(yelling) Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much (Joey covers Hugsy's ears) Oh don't cover its ears! (stops yelling) It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!","Frustration, Affection, Love, Nostalgia"
It does?,Curiosity
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.,"Affection, Love"
Really? She... she loves me?,Unknown
"Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever (She leaves the room).","Jealousy, Gratitude, Love"

How do you think I got him in the first place?,Frustration
"Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.","Boredom, Embarrassment"
"I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.","Affection, Love, Heartbreak, Nostalgia"
"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?","Anxiety, Doubt"
"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time...  I never would have stopped.","Love, Heartbreak, Nostalgia"
"(running back into the room) Kiss him, you fool!!",Excitement
What?,Frustration
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!,"Frustration, Jealousy"

I look like a man??,"Embarrassment, Insecurity"
"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!","Frustration, Overwhelm"
"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!",Frustration
"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!","Frustration, Disappointment"
"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?","Frustration, Loneliness, Disappointment"
"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?","Affection, Gratitude"
(sceptical) Yeah...,Doubt
"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide. (Ross hides in the bedroom again)",Frustration

I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.,Unknown
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,Curiosity
We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.,"Enthusiasm, Affection, Nostalgia"
"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.","Affection, Gratitude, Love"
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.,Unknown
"(he bounds into the lounge room) But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!","Overwhelm, Gratitude, Excitement"
"You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you! (she leaves and slams the door behind her)","Heartbreak, Betrayal, Disappointment, Anger"
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!,Excitement
"(on the phone) No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok?
