(he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love   you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly   books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico.   A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and   forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love   you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby   you’ll be”.

And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll   like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.","Enthusiasm, Affection, Love, Relaxation, Nostalgia, Contentment, Interest"

Amazing... amazing.,Awe
"Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.",Satisfaction
"That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to   hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts   singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma!   Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy   birthday Emma!",Enthusiasm
Is that it?,"Frustration, Disappointment"
"No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks   up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.","Curiosity, Confusion"

I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.,Frustration
"No, no, this is not what I ordered.   Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for   my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!",Frustration
"Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the   penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!","Frustration, Boredom, Disappointment"
"Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even   want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a   piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!","Frustration, Anger"
