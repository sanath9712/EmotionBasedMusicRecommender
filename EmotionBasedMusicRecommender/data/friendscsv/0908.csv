"Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?"
"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our  wedding china today?"
"No, I think we should save our china for something  really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over."
"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint."
"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive."
"What is the point of having them if we never use  them?"
"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen  comes over.."
"I will explain it to her."
"<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you  talk to the queen."
"wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those  horses can crap."
"Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK."
"Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo  hoo!"
"Oh my God!"
"Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime  soap Days of Our Lives?"
"Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I  can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm."
"What are you going to do?"
"I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really  good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.  They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00  AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot."
"Well you proved them wrong."
"A lot of people are thankful for those."
"Hello? Rachel?"
"Who is it?"
"It's your favorite sister."
"Hide my rings."
"Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily  says>"
"Do you have a hair straightener?"
"Um... hi."
"oh... hi.. <goes to Rachel with open arms>"
"Aw."
"Hair Straightener?"
"I haven't seen you in like.. a year."
"Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed."
"Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby."
"I decorated Dad's office."
"Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your  vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing."
"Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really  need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house."
"Oh my God!"
"mh hmm.."
"Is this Emmett? <pointing to EMMA>"
"Uh.... its Emma."
"Its a girl?"
"Hey Amy."
"Oh Amy, you remember Ross."
"Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy  she used to date."
"That was me."
"No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had  this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade."
"No, I'm not talking about you. <to Rachel> It  was your fat"
"Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful.  CAREFUL!"
"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives,  I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute  this isn't the china we picked out.."
"I know, after you left the store, I chose different  ones."
"Why?"
"well no offense honey, but your taste is a little  feminine for me."
"Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?"
"Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!"
"Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to  come over>"
"Hey, what's going on Joe?"
"I.. I.. I need a good lie."
"Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on  the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!"
"No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't  at a work thing today."
"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying."
"I do not."
"Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday  at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin  was gone-who took it?"
"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a  raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey  don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. <pause> He said.. "Joey  you stink at lying." What am I going to do?"
"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good  lie. I'll help you practice it."
"Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you."
"Sure, what.. what was the work thing?"
"Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls  up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>"
""Pick up grandma at the airport"?"
"Oh.. man.."
"Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs  Ross' hand for support>"
"Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. <to Ross and Rachel> Can  I take this upstairs?"
"Sure, we don't live there but..."
"Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands  around motioning 'just these rooms'> <To Ross> I thought you were  a doctor."
"Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD."
"Ew. <walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing>"
"God she is unbelievable."
"I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD."
"Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a  restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush."
"What? What happened?"
"My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find  a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then  his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married  guys."
"Don't say that."
"Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to  be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi."
"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk  to you in private?"
"Sure, you want to go upstairs?"
"Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I  would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving."
"You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like  the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis."
"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has  no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I  would like them to bond."
"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I  don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job."
"Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just  going to have to make our peace with that!"
"Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is  Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon."
"Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives."
"wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you."
"Hi."
"Hi."
"So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're  seeing Emma?"
"Oh. That's a funny noise."
"Pheebs, I still need some help here"
"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.  but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when  you're talking, people know you're lying."
"Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..  I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor."
"Oh we just put her down for a nap."
"Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible?  If you guys died."
"no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it  would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her,  then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then  I'd get married."
"Thats a great movie. <she claps>"
"Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything  cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just  not really a big fan of Emily. [Transcriber note: I'm surprised that Rachel  and Ross didn't say they weren't either here]"
"Emma."
"Emma, Ross wants you."
"PHOE-BE."
"Why does she keep making that  noise?"
"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um,  if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock  on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby."
"Well who would?"
"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would  want Monica and Chandler."
"I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma."
"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved."
"I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die  and I don't get your baby?"
"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.  We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected  to the baby."
"Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's  a lump."
"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much  to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica  and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts  about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts  to cry>"
"<points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously?"
"Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using  our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful."
"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will  not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>"
"Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?  Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?"
"No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See  its a game, whoever gets that plate wins."
"I can't believe I won."
"Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you  would give your baby to these strangers over me."
"Monica is Ross' sister."
"No, Ross' sister was really fat."
"That was me."
"No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that  used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog."
"Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that."
"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets  face it you have fun."
"Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate  lady dies, then do I get the baby?"
"No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated  at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?"
"Well actually..."
"Actually what?"
"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma  would go to my parents."
"What?"
"Hurts, doesn't it?"
"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough  to raise Emma?"
"Yeah he's lying. He looked down."
"Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent?  Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!"
"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think  you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent."
"Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like  Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict."
"Thats not how you see me, is it?"
"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do  you really think I'm not capable?"
"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're  strongest when.. when you're together."
"Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks  on table>  she'd have to give her up."
"Sure, Monica would have to give her up."
"I lie better then that, right?"
"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends  die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left  in my life gets taken away from me?"
"There's your movie! <claps>"
"Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner."
"Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise  poorly?"
"Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about.  I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of  Merlot and a five year old condom."
"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong  father figure and I never will be."
"No you learn these things. You grow into it."
"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said  was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody  knows it."
"I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because  I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard  parts."
"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go  to your room! You're grounded"?"
"Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?"
"You said that to me last week."
"How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture."
"It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's  easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the  parade because you had a family emergency."
"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because  I had a family emergency."
"Ooh, what happened?"
"No! Nothing with a raccoon."
"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands  out in the air>"
"Oh wait.. What are you doing?"
"Setting the table."
"Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy  china for dessert too."
"Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses  on my wedding dress."
"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before."
"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't  know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I  want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey."
"Ucch.  <pauses> Uchh <louder  this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you."
"UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>"
"You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel."
"Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when  I died and didn't give you my baby?"
"This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I  mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer."
"What? What carrer?"
"Um.. I'm a decorator."
"Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a  decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear."
"Why can't you ever be supportive?"
"Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even  come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby."
"Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in  the hospital when I was getting my lips done."
"I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks  into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving  Emily to you."
"Emma."
"Oh whose side are you on? <back  to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle  the responibility of a child."
"How hard could it be? You do it."
"ooh oooh.."
"Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have  the baby?"
"uh huh."
"Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have  always been jealous of me."
"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You,  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?"
"Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You've  just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't  have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do  you even realize how much that hurt me?"
"Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!"
"Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it."
"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here  today."
"Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called  sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail."
"ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's  forty five."
"You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your  new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns  throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something.  Your baby isn't even that cute."
"You take that back."
"No."
"Take it back!"
"No! What are you going to do? Make me?"
"Heey man, I work out."
"So do I."
"I do pilates."
"I do yoga."
"Bring it on!"
"Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the  boxes!"
"Did you just push me?"
"Uh, yeah I think I did."
"Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>"
"Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't  time!"
"Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?"
"What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello  on them."
"Ew! Gross."
"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and  you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't  be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones  I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize  to her right now."
"I'm sorry."
"Mon, I'm so sorry."
"Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize  to each other and mean it."
"By the way, that fight was totally arousing."
"Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel  dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma."
"Oh yeah? Well thanks."
"So, so now do I get Joey?"
"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a  day and shoves pennies up his nose."
"Are you okay Mon?"
"uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a  plate. Its not like somebody died."
"It's all right. You can mourn."
"Actually its not pies, its just pie."
"I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my  god. I've lost the will to scold."
"Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm  sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.."
"So you're going to give me the baby?"
"Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren  discount."
"She needs changing."
"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there  Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of  china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first."
"Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?"
"Nope..."
"Broke them all, huh?"
"Yep..."
"You gonna tell her?"
"Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna...  put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should  use these plates again for a looong time."
"Like only if the queen comes?"
"Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)"
"Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had  a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie  Pheebs."
"No problem! Next week: stealing... (Chandler walks  away to store the box of broken china.)"
"Bye plates!"
"Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler  walks back, looking angrily at Joey)"
"What? Something happened with the plates?"
"Uhm... (looks down) Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came  in..."
