"Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!"
"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conferencecould've been in Connecticut or Vermont."
"I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want peopleto think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference."
"(entering) Hey."
"Hey!"
"Hey."
"Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her."
"No, she's out shopping."
"Damn!"
"What's going on?"
"I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it."
"Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna seeRachel anymore?"
"Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see mywife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this. (He takes a big swigof"
"Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?How is that even gonna work?"

"So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and"
"Yeah that's better than my way."
"Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?"
"Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)"
"(going through the mail) Oh look! A letter from my mom."
"So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?"
"Oh yeah! I know."
"(To Chandler) Can you hear anything?"
"Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?""
"Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?"
"(holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and brokeup and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel atthe wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here."
"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…"
"Ooh,"
"Condoms?"
"You don't know how long we're gonna be in here!"
"And condoms are the way to do that?"
"Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked toEmily…"
"(interrupting) Oh my God! My dog died!"
"What?!"
"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!"
"Le Poo's still alive?!"
"Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged fornine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. Oh. (They all come out from Monica's bedroom) Ohmy God."
"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry."
"It's Le Poo."
"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
"(jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!"
"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!"
"Oh, you should live with Joey,"
"Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back."
"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!"
"We're switching rooms."
"(looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave usglasses!"
"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn'tchange the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come onsweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
"Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it'sfeed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)"
"Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?"
"Oh yeah! (Turns to face him.)"
"Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there'sthis one thing… Okay, (Rachel has her back turned to the camera, and Ross isn'tlooking at her.) here goes. I made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and Rossnotices something coming out of Rachel's nose)-Oh hey!"
"What?"
"You're nose is bleeding!"
"Oh God. (He hands her some tissues.) No! Oh not again! (Wiping hernose.) This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. (She puts her headback.) Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?"
"Umm… (Rachel blows her nose.)"
"Sorry. Sorry."
"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore."
"Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either."
"I think you'll find this room more to your liking."
"Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)"
"(watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left."
"Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!"
"We're switching rooms again."
"What? Why?"
"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
"Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you."
"(To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just asecond?"
"Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)"
"Chandler!"
"(turning to face her) Yeah."
"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonnalet 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!"
"I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can youjust pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
"Okay,"
"(watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This isregularly scheduled programming!"
"Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entireweekend like this?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggageto 10 different rooms?"
"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albanyto Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
"Do not speak ill of the dead."
"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it,what is the matter with you?"
"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez,relax mom."
"What did you say?"
"I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn.""
"Hi!"
"Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while nowand I really, I just have to get it out."
"Okay, what's up?"
"Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix mymarriage?"
"Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants."
"And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what shewants…"
"Yeah?"
"…is for me not to see you anymore."
"That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause)(Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?"
"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I wantmy marriage to work. And I do, I have to make"
"Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That"
"You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard."
"Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just alittle bit easier for you."
"What are you doing?"
"Storming out!"
"Rachel, this is your apartment."
"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!"
"Damn"
"Hey, you're back!"
"Hey."
"How was your conference?"
"It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, theentire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another"
"Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"
"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator."
"(entering) Hi!"
"Hey, you're back too!"
"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?"
"Hey, how was your chef thing?"
"Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don'tappreciate really good food."
"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but thenmade everybody vomit and have diarrhea."
"Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)"
"Monica. (Follows her out.)"
"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay myhalf."
"Okay, fine, $300."
"300 dollars?!"
"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!"
"Urghh!!"
"(sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?"
"Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!"
"Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myselfwithout twenties and"
"You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! Idon't know what to do."
"You want my advice?"
"Yes! Please!"
"You're not gonna like it."
"That's okay."
"You got married to fast."
"That's not advice!"
"I told ya."
"I'm going to the bathroom. (Gets up and exits.)"
"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it."
""
"Maybe I could do it."
"(entering) Hi!"
"Hi, Rach."
"Hi!"
"Hey."
"Hey."
"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross buty'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just"
"I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is rightback there. (Points over his shoulder.)"
"That's not Ross!"
"Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though."
"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom."
"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip."
"Hey, you're not Kip!"
"(To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?"
"Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?"
"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
"Oh, that poor bastard."
"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke upthey couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stayhis friend and what happened? He got phased out!"
"You're not gonna be phased out!"
"Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.(To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time beforesomeone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go."
"Ehh!!"
"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift rightout."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left aneyelash curler in your room."
"Yes that was mine."
"'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there."
"Yes that would have made more sense."
"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look,I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Wereyou, or were you not on a gay cruise?!"
"Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the wholelifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!"
"Come where?"
"Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we'rethe best ones."
"Okay, but try and get Joey too."
"(entering) Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?"
"Oh, sure! (She gets up to leave.) Bye Ross! (Whispering behind hisback.) Forever."
"Hi."
"Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?"
"I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice."
"Oh, Ross…"
"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see theirsisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joeyat"
"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you."
"Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would youdo?"
"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!"
"I can't believe this is happening."
"I know."
"I am so sorry."
"I know that too."
"(entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorryto interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something."
"(entering) Hey!"
"Hi."
"I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kindasucked, huh?"
"Yeah, it did."
"So, I guess this is over."
"What?"
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
"Why, exactly?"
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
"Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight withsomeone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize somethingthere.)"
"So, this isn't over?"
"(laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it andmove on! It's nothing to freak out about."
"Really? Okay. Great!"
"Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)"
"(stops her) We're in a relationship?"
"I'm afraid so."
"Okay."
"Hey!"
"Hey!"
"Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention."
"Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator."
"Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine."
"Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)"
"(shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!"
"Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to dragJoey into Monica's room.)"
"Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!"
"Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!"
"Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)"
"(To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!"
"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
"How?! When?!"
"It happened in London."
""
"The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make abig deal out of it."
"But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!"
"No-no-no-no-no! You can't!"
"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?Just promise you won't tell."
"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's"
"I know, it's great!"
"Aww, I don't want to see that!"
"We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying totake Joey!"
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And ifyou win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!""
"Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count."
"Count for what?"
"Count in our heads as-as good"
"I guess I'm done."
"Fun's over!"
"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it meanssomething!"
"Uh-huh!"
"I think I'm gonna take-off."
"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave andclose the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)"
