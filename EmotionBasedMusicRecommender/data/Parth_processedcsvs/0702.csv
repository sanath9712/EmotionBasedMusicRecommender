(he puts the book back and picks up another) “Love   you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly   books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico.   A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and   forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I’ll love   you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby   you’ll be”. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book).   And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll   like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.","Love, Excitement, Nostalgia"

Is that it?,"Neutral, Anticipation, Confusion"
"No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks   up a book). “Sex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.","Confidence, Surprise, Excitement"

"I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!","Confidence, Surprise, Excitement"
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.,"Anger, Disgust, Frustration"
"No, no, this is not what I ordered.   Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for   my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!","Anger, Frustration"
"Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the   penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!","Surprise, Disgust, Confusion"
"Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even   want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a   piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!","Anger, Fear, Frustration"

"Hey, good race you guys.","Happiness, Confidence, Excitement"
"Yeah, see you later!","Happiness, Contentment, Excitement"
"No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly   stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog   never crossed the finish line, so technically...","Confidence, Frustration, Optimism"
They left.,"Neutral, Sadness, Disgust"

"Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.   (he opens the box)","Confidence, Excitement, Anticipation"
"Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday...   And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According   to the back cover of that book that you gave me.","Sadness, Frustration"
"Rach, she's not going to remember this.","Contentment, Confidence, Neutral"
"(shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this   day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her   cake singing Happy Birthday"".

"Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this   to make ears.","Happiness, Contentment, Confidence"
"Well, I'm very impressed.","Happiness, Contentment, Confidence"
"Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into   woodland creatures.","Happiness, Contentment, Excitement"
"Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.","Contentment, Confidence, Excitement"
"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?","Surprise, Confusion, Frustration"
