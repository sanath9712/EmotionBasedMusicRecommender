dialogue
"It’s a tradition here on"
"Once and a while."
"From time to time."
"For example, I don’t have to memorize lines. You guys actually haveto remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?"
"Our energy just comes way up when there’s an audience here andwhen that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and itjust doesn’t, it just doesn’t work."
"Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn’t. I did."
"Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (He starts laughing, causing everyoneelse to laugh.)"
"So, we realize that—Oh no… (She resets herself) I’mtelling it! I’m telling it… (She loses it.)"
"Ha-ha. Look—Come on, I don’t know what to do…or say. (Helaughs.)"
"Ha-ha, very funny. I don’t know what to do! Y’know? Holy crud!"
"Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I don’t know what to do! (Long pause, aseveryone cracks up.)"
"It is one of those days!"
"‘Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay—[Beep]—uck it!"
"Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?"
"You still get nervous everybody just before a show?"
"Absolutely."
"Everybody."
"It’s amazing like all week long we’ve-we’ve been sayingthe same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once,then you’ll get nervous because you’ll—you know you’ll probably messup again."
"Action!"
"(holding her hand in front of her face) When you were little you sleptthrough-through the Grand Canyon."
"Watch again that hand."
"This’ll be five/ten takes."
"Okay."
"Okay. You know it’s gonna happen."
"Once again, and action!"
"(the hand’s still there) When-when you were little you sleptthrough the Grand Canyon. (She actually itches her nose this time.)"
"Oh! Okay! I’m gonna try it without the coffee cup ‘cause Ithink it’s the left hand that’s messing me up."
"When you were little you slept through the Grand—(Pointingagain)—Oh fffff…."
"Sorry, let’s go back! ‘Cause you’ve got more to say."
"Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that’s your fault. I…say."
"I love you."
"I love you! (They hug.)"
"But there must be, there must—are a lot of moments over the yearswhere you’re just trying to do your job, something goes wrong."
"Hey and, this is a little extra something for y’know, always beingthere for me."
"Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!"
"What?!"
"Ahh! Sh—(Beep)—it that hurt!"
"Are you okay?"
"Hey Rach! (She breaks up and goes back into Monica’s.)"
"Oh yeah? Then how come I keep—(He notices that the marker board theyuse has been left on the entertainment center and holds up his discovery.)"
"It was so wild! We told ‘em we were the Gunderson’s in16…"
"(laughing) I spit on her!"
"(to Lisa)"
"Oh yeah!"
"With"
"It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer."
"Oh-ooh, and I brought"
"But le Blanc really doesn’t mess up much."
"You don’t verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up."
"I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call ‘em."
"He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. Andhe—(laughs)—he was afraid he was gonna fall down…"
"You could actually see him trying not to fall down."
"Pheebs! (He looks down as he goes down the step to make sure hedidn’t fall again.) Check it out! (He starts laughing when he realized what he did.)"
"This particular time when he continued to fall or y’know, try notto fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, "Should I do it?""
"Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! (Hands herone.)"
"Ooh,"
"Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimesyou like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something’s naturallygoing wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?"
"I don’t necessarily like to juice things…"
"He said true or false!"
"Oh! Ooh-ooh!"
"What are you doing?!"
"You’re still a tiny bit on fire there."
"Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!"
"It was great seeing you the other night."
"Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell methat?"
"Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came hereto tell you I still love you."
"What the fu—(beep)—ck are you doing?!"
"Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with amonkey…"
"That damn monkey."
"That damn monkey."
"Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That’s Dr.Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There—(Marcel (Katie) jumps away)—Okay.(And runs behind her on the back of the couch for a little while.)"
"Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here—Katie! (Katie spills somepopcorn.) Katie, come here Katie. (She obeys and sits where she’s supposed to.) Verygood."
"Lisa’s laugh though…There’s—It’s soinfectious. It’s one of those things…just forget about it. Once it starts,it’s all gone."
"No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wetpaper towels here!"
"Well at Monica’s you can eat—(Suddenly cracks up.)"
"Okay, shh yeah. ‘Cause it’s not silly."
"Here we go."
"Okay."
"And…action!"
"No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph… (She starts laughing.)"
"(to Lisa) Ready?"
"Yeah."
"And then it just builds on itself and there’s no doing the sceneafter. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it."
"For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when—Imean when…"
"(to Matt) You bastard."
"Yeah, what did I do?"
"…I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction toyou, or a certain take, I-I—I mean I find it"
"Mornin’"
"Mornin’"
"I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say,"Hmm, noodle soup?""
"That’s a good one? (They both laugh.)"
"Now, we should go back and take the other line."
"Okay, I’ll just put a little more booze on there. (Pours some moreon.)"
"I think, subconsciously…"
"(cracking up) Nope, you lost me."
"No! Come on!"
"Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start youwalk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. (Ross lies on thefloor.) I’ll be Monica. Go! (He jumps down and cuddles up with Ross.)"
"(jumping up) No! No! No!"
"We’ll be right back with more"
"I’m doing my brother."
"That’s…gross."
"You uh, you’ve worked with—They always say a performer shouldnever work with pets or children."
"Aww, the kids."
"Action."
"Okay. Now—What is my first line?"
"(prompting her) What did we agree?"
"Okay…"
"The good thing about the young kids though, they’re completelyunpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was onestory…"
"Oh little Ben."
"Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around tohear my son’s first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasn’tsupposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show…"
"Hi! We’re visiting!"
"Yay!"
"It’s Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y’know, youmight as well say it because I told your…"
"Da…Da."
"Can you say Da-Da? See, I’m gonna tell your mommies you said itanyway, so you might as well try…"
"Da…Da."
"Huh?"
"Da…Da."
"Yeah, he’s saying Da-Da."
"And then sometimes during the show y’know but you’re like, thescene’s going one way but you’re just tempted to say something another time.Like, do you remember that one where Monica’s baking cookies in our old apartment?"
"She’s trying to intrigue us to hang out with her."
"Yeah, she’s trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us tocome hang out in her new place, and we’re sitting there eating pizza and I think itwas you (Points to Lisa) that said…"
"What do I smell?"
"I think I was supposed to say, "I don’t know," and go overand open the door. And I went…"
"What do I smell?"
"(Pause) Sorry. (Raises his hand in shame.)"
"(everyone laughs) And then it was like four takes later before we couldget through it with a straight face."
"What do I smell?"
"Le Blanc."
"What do I smell?"
"I don’t know, but it smells good. (He gets up and heads for the dooronly to stop short and start laughing.)"
"But audiences—You have a live studio audience and they must lovethat. They must love it when they see you guys playing."
"What are you guys doing?"
"Nothing."
"Nothin’."
"So that you will intentionally do somethingthat—they’ll-they’ll intentionally screw it up?"
"Yeah!"
"Yeah!"
"(noticing the laughter) Why? What’s the matter?"
"(to Courtney) You-you’ve worn a fat suit on the show. And, a lot ofpeople love you in the fat suit. Do you like wearing the fat suit? Is it fun?"
"I’m melting!"
"They made me dance, in the fat suit."
"I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimesthere’s just a word that someone has to say that you’ll get hung up on. Andit’ll just—the way you say the word is funny to everybody else."
"That tastes like feet!"
"It tastes like (mimicking him in a high-pitched voice) feet!"
"Okay, we’re good."
"Action!"
"That tastes like feet!"
"Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny andyou’ll—we’ll be rehearsing during the week and youjust—whatever-whatever the joke is; it’s so funny we can’t get through itin rehearsal and just…"
"You just know."
"You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "Okay show night,I’m just—I’ll never be able to get through this.""
"Are you saying that you don’t want to get with this?"
"You see, I don’t say—(Starts laughing.)"
"(spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) Oh, sweetJe—(Beep)—sus! Oh! Monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!"
"(noticing the woman on the screen) Whoa! She’s purty!"
"Oh yeah, and she’s really nice too! She taught me about y’know,how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting."
"Joey?"
"I’m sorry…"
"Excuse me, what?"
"When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be;there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of ascene."
"Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up astair—a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably…I-I think it wasthe hardest I’ve-I’ve laughed in my life period."
"Pivot! (They pivot) Pivot! (They pivot) Okay, pivot! Piv-at! (He startslaughing.)"
"Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!"
"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!"
"Pivat!! (In a high pitched voice) Pivat!!!"
"You’ve done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80years from now you’ll be thinking about?"
"It is when we’re able to crack each other up."
"Monica’s gotta have the phone in the right placeand—(Frantic babbling.)"
"(To Chandler) All right! All right! All right! (To Joey) We"
"He’s gone. He’s…"
"We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each other’sperformance, and we like each other."
"Oh the band’s ready! And well—I-I—we gotta do what the bandsays, right? I don’t care about the stinkin’ band!!"
"Okay"
"Well thank you so much."
"Thank you Conan!"
"Well thank for coming here, it’s good to see you."
"Thank you my babies. (Waves good-bye.)"
"Oh what are doing?!"
"You’re still a tiny bit on fire there!"
"I think you got it!"
"I’m sorry, I messed up."
"I’ll do it again and again if you want."
"No-no! I’ll-I’ll… (He takes too much and some falls out ofhis mouth, which starts him laughing.)"
"That is too much!"
"Let me start that again."
