"Yes!"
"Why?"
"I have my reasons."
"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who justhappens to be your ex-best friend?"

"What was with the dishes?"
"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? Imight have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the pastfew hours."
"(looking out the window) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy withthe telescope!"
"Oh my God! (Walks to the window) Go away! (Gesturing.) Stop looking inhere!"

"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught himlooking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
"What kinda stuff?"
"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'mcooking naked."
"You cook naked?"
"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
"What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that."
"What's the matter?"
"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
"No, it was. It was very very good."
"Well, what about Mindy?"
"Oh, way, way better than Mindy."
"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
"Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her."

"What?!"
"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
"Can I use your phone?"
"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also beused as a phone."
"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
"Maybe she never got your message."
"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot ofbeeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
"Y'don't think that makes me seem a little..."
"...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
"How many beeps?"
"She answered."
"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and ischoosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
"Hey! Hi!"
"How'd he take it?"
"Pretty well, actually... (Wandering into the kitchen.)"
"(wandering in after her) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss inyour hair?"
"Oh, do I?"

"No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
"Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, righthere, right now," what would you say?"
"If it helps, I could slide over."
